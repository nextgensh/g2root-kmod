Follow these instructions to gain temporary root accesss.
1. Upload the psneuter binary onto your phone using adb
   >> adb push psneuter /data/local/tmp/
2. Run the binary
   >> adb shell /data/local/tmp/psneuter
3. Open another terminal and kill the adb process if you see the prompt has hung (most comon case)
   >> adb kill-server
4. Reopen the adb connection and you should have root access with PS1 as #
   >> adb shell

This is a reliable method as we don't wait for adb to restart manually.
